# Completeness, Contamination, and strain heterogeneity are provided by the user or calculated with checkM. 
# N50 is a measure of how big the pieces are that make up the genome. size is the total length of the genome. 
# Centrality is a measure of how similar a genome is to all other genomes in itâ€™s cluster. This metric helps 
# pick genome that are similar to all other genomes, and avoid picking genomes that are relative outliers.
