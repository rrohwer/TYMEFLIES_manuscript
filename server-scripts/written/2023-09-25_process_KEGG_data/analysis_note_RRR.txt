fixed pathway script to address the bug and re-ran those two genomes' lines from the jobfile, no errors now.

also re-ran the two genome's lines from the find consistent genes jobfile too. no errors again.


so NOTE that if you simply re-run the scripts as is everything should reproduce without errors, there will be no need to single out these genomes in future re-runs.
